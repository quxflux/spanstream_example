# spanstream example

This repo contains examples demonstrating the usage of [std::spanstream](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_spanstream) and the performance differences arising from using `spanstream` over traditional `iostreams`.

## notes
Implemented using Visual Studio 2022 17.5.4. The code in this repo may not neccessarily be compilable using other compilers (e.g. gcc).
